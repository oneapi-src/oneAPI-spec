How to contribute

This specification is a continuation of Intelâ€™s decades-long history
of working with standards groups and industry/academia initiatives
such as The Khronos Group, to create and define specifications in an
open and fair process to achieve interoperability and
interchangeability. oneAPI is intended to be an open specification and
we encourage you to help us make it better. Your feedback is optional,
but to enable Intel to incorporate any feedback you may provide to
this specification, and to further upstream your feedback to other
standards bodies, including The Khronos Group SYCL specification,
please submit your feedback under the terms and conditions below. Any
contribution of your feedback to the oneAPI Specification does not
prohibit you from also contributing your feedback directly to other
standard bodies, including The Khronos Group under their respective
submission policies.

Contribute to the oneAPI Specification by opening issues in the oneAPI
Specification `GitHub repository`_ or providing feedback in any other
oneAPI Specification forum.
