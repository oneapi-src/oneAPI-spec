Future considerations
---------------------
The following items are being considered for future versions of this specification:

* Encapsulation of matrix and vector information in classes.  Matrix storage information could also be encapsulated.
* More human-readable names for linear algebra functionality, aligned with the P1673 C++ proposal.
* Broader support for row major layout.
* Alternative handling of computational failures.
