/*!
   @brief 
     This function works in either of four modes:
     
     If the in pointer is zero, the function returns the class configurability in the output structure. A non-zero value in each field of the output structure 
     that the SDK implementation can configure the field with Init.
     
     If the in parameter is non-zero, the function checks the validity of the fields in the input structure. Then the function returns the corrected values in 
     the output structure. If there is insufficient information to determine the validity or correction is impossible, the function zeroes the fields. 
     This feature can verify whether the SDK implementation supports certain profiles, levels or bitrates.
    
     If the in parameter is non-zero and mfxExtEncoderResetOption structure is attached to it, then the function queries for the outcome of the MFXVideoENCODE_Reset function 
     and returns it in the mfxExtEncoderResetOption structure attached to out. The query function succeeds if such reset is possible and returns error otherwise. Unlike other 
     modes that are independent of the SDK encoder state, this one checks if reset is possible in the present SDK encoder state. 
     This mode also requires completely defined mfxVideoParam structure, unlike other modes that support partially defined configurations. 
     See mfxExtEncoderResetOption description for more details.

     If the in parameter is non-zero and mfxExtEncoderCapability structure is attached to it, then the function returns encoder capability in mfxExtEncoderCapability structure 
     attached to out. It is recommended to fill in mfxVideoParam structure and set hardware acceleration device handle before calling the function in this mode.

     The application can call this function before or after it initializes the encoder. The CodecId field of the output structure is a mandated field (to be filled by the 
     application) to identify the coding standard.

   @brief 
    This function takes a single input frame in either encoded or display order and generates its output bitstream. In the case of encoded ordering the mfxEncodeCtrl 
    structure must specify the explicit frame type. In the case of display ordering, this function handles frame order shuffling according to the GOP structure 
    parameters specified during initialization.
    
    Since encoding may process frames differently from the input order, not every call of the function generates output and the function returns MFX_ERR_MORE_DATA.
    If the encoder needs to cache the frame, the function locks the frame. The application should not alter the frame until the encoder unlocks the frame. 
    If there is output (with return status MFX_ERR_NONE), the return is a frame worth of bitstream.
    
    It is the calling application's responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient space in the output buffer. The value BufferSizeInKB in the
    mfxVideoParam structure at encoding initialization specifies the maximum possible size for any compressed frames. This value can also be obtained from 
    MFXVideoENCODE_GetVideoParam after encoding initialization.

/*!
   @brief 
   This function decodes the input bitstream to a single output frame.

   The surface_work parameter provides a working frame buffer for the decoder. The application should allocate the working frame buffer, which stores decoded frames. 
   If the function requires caching frames after decoding, the function locks the frames and the application must provide a new frame buffer in the next call.

   If, and only if, the function returns MFX_ERR_NONE, the pointer surface_out points to the output frame in the display order. If there are no further frames, 
   the function will reset the pointer to zero and return the appropriate status code.

   Before decoding the first frame, a sequence header(sequence parameter set in H.264 or sequence header in MPEG-2 and VC-1) must be present. The function skips any 
   bitstreams before it encounters the new sequence header.

   The input bitstream bs can be of any size. If there are not enough bits to decode a frame, the function returns MFX_ERR_MORE_DATA, and consumes all input bits except if 
   a partial start code or sequence header is at the end of the buffer. In this case, the function leaves the last few bytes in the bitstream buffer. 
   If there is more incoming bitstream, the application should append the incoming bitstream to the bitstream buffer. Otherwise, the application should ignore the 
   remaining bytes in the bitstream buffer and apply the end of stream procedure described below.

   The application must set bs to NULL to signal end of stream. The application may need to call this function several times to drain any internally cached frames until the 
   function returns MFX_ERR_MORE_DATA.

   If more than one frame is in the bitstream buffer, the function decodes until the buffer is consumed. The decoding process can be interrupted for events such as if the 
   decoder needs additional working buffers, is readying a frame for retrieval, or encountering a new header. In these cases, the function returns appropriate status code 
   and moves the bitstream pointer to the remaining data.
   
   The decoder may return MFX_ERR_NONE without taking any data from the input bitstream buffer. If the application appends additional data to the bitstream buffer, it 
   is possible that the bitstream buffer may contain more than 1 frame. It is recommended that the application invoke the function repeatedly until the function 
   returns MFX_ERR_MORE_DATA, before appending any more data to the bitstream buffer. 
   This function is asynchronous.

     This function works in one of two modes:

     1.If the in pointer is zero, the function returns the class configurability in the output structure. A non-zero value in a field indicates that the

     2.If the in parameter is non-zero, the function checks the validity of the fields in the input structure. Then the function returns the corrected values to
     the output structure. If there is insufficient information to determine the validity or correction is impossible, the function zeroes the fields.

     The application can call this function before or after it initializes the preprocessor.
