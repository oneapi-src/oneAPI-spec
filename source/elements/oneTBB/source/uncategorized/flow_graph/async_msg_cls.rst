async_msg Template Class
========================


Summary
-------

``async_msg`` is a special message class used to implement intercommunication
between a TBB flow graph and an external parallel
activity, such as a thread or a device.

Syntax
------

.. code:: cpp

   template < typename T >
   class async_msg;


Header
------

.. code:: cpp

   #define TBB_PREVIEW_FLOW_GRAPH_FEATURES 1
   #include "oneapi/tbb/flow_graph.h"


Description
-----------

An ``async_msg``, or a user type derived from ``async_msg``,
acts like a "future" that is specially handled by flow graph nodes.
An ``async_msg<T>`` is a representation of an asynchronous job result
of type ``T`` that can be processed by the graph while the result is not
ready yet. The result can be provided by the asynchronous activity with the
``async_msg<T>::set( T result )`` method at any moment.
Other classes can inherit from ``async_msg<T>`` to
create advanced async messages with additional data. Ports and nodes  that accept
messages of type ``T`` and async messages can both receive async messages
and can be connected with the ``make_edge`` interface, but handle them
differently.
If the node accepts an async message, it reacts to an incoming async message immediately,
for example, by passing the message directly to its body. However, if the node accepts the
result type ``T``, the virtual method
``async_msg<T>::finalize()`` is called and the node waits
for the result availability. The ``async_msg<T>::finalize()`` method
can be overridden in a derived async message type, for example, to notify the asynchronous
activity that a result is required and/or to set a callback.

.. caution::

   The method ``async_msg<T>::set( T result )`` must be called
   at most once. If the async message is never passed to a node that accepts the
   results of asynchronous activity than the result can be never set.
   However, if the async message is passed to a node that accepts the result of
   async message (the ``finalize()`` method is called in this case),
   the result must be set.

.. note::

   If a node accepts an async message, but a message of result type
   ``T`` is provided to the node, an async message is automatically
   created and the incoming message of type ``T`` is immediately
   set as its result.

.. note::

   Nodes or ports that accept async messages can accept only an async message of the
   same type or a message of the result type. Therefore, it is impossible to pass
   ``async_msg<T>`` to a node that accepts async messages of
   derived type from ``async_msg<T>``.

.. note::

   The current implementation can call the ``async_msg<T>::finalize()``
   method many times and does not call the method if the result has been previously set.
   However, this behavior can be changed in future releases.

The ``graph::wait_for_all()`` method waits until the results are ready for all
async messages created and consumed by nodes of the graph. However, if async messages
are created and sent to the graph by an external activity, it must use
``increment_ref_count()`` and ``decrement_ref_count()`` methods
to prevent completion of the graph before it sends all the async messages. Once an async message
is sent to the graph, ``wait_for_all()`` waits for its result to be ready.

The simplest usage scenario of the ``async_msg`` is shown in the figure
below: the left flow graph node (n1) starts an asynchronous activity in its body and
returns an ``async_msg`` object without waiting for the result to be set.
The next node (n2) automatically receives the ready result when it is set by the
asynchronous activity through its copy of the ``async_msg``.

The simplest scenario steps are described below:

* A ``function_node`` n1 creates an instance of ``async_msg<T>``.
* n1 sends work to an external asynchronous activity along with a copy of the ``async_msg``.
* n1 puts ``async_msg<T>`` to its successor.
* The external asynchronous activity returns the result back to the flow graph by calling the
  method ``set(result)`` in the ``async_msg`` instance obtained in step 2.
* The successor node gets the data of type ``T`` as usual.

   The simplest scenario with the async_msg.


In this scenario, ``async_msg`` and ``function_node`` together
provide behavior very similar to the ``async_node`` class.

The main advantage of ``async_msg`` over the ``async_node`` is
the ability to pass such a message through the flow graph unmodified or even updated,
as in the following usage scenario:

* A ``function_node`` n1 creates an instance of ``async_msg<T>``.
* n1 sends work to an external asynchronous activity, along with a copy of the ``async_msg``.
* n1 puts ``async_msg<T>`` to the next node n2.
* n2 sends the second part of work to an external asynchronous activity.
  It can update the ``async_msg`` message instance if itâ€™s needed.
* When the ``async_msg<T>`` comes to the final node (receiving
  type ``T``) in the graph, its virtual method ``finalize()``
  is automatically called by the library. This method might be overridden in custom
  asynchronous messages. Its intended use is to set a callback for the asynchronous
  activity to return its result to the flow graph.
  
  .. note::

     ``async_msg<T>::finalize()`` may be called a few times by the library,
     but the method is never called after the ``set()`` method has been
     invoked on the ``async_msg``.
  
* The next node n3 gets the ``UserDataType`` data as usual.

   :width: 654
   :height: 372

   The scenario with a processing chain.
        

.. note::

   Usually the first node in the processing chain uploads data to the external asynchronous
   activity (thread or device). The next nodes in the chain can continue the data processing
   without any additional data uploading and downloading. And only the last node in the chain
   gets the activity result.

Any user class derived from ``async_msg`` can be used in the use-cases above.
For example, a derived asynchronous message class can be implemented that stores or updates
additional states or flags while the data processing chain is working.

Example
-------

The example below shows a ``source_node`` that submits some work to
``AsyncActivity`` for processing by a user thread. An ``async_msg``
is used to communicate the result to a downstream ``function_node``.

\ ``void set(T&& t)``

\ PROTECTED, 
==========================================================================================
\ ``virtual void finalize() const``
  \
  Overrides the method in the derived class to inform the asynchronous activity
  that the data handling chain is over and the activity should return the result
  (via the ``set()`` call).
  
  .. note::

     An asynchronous activity can call the ``set()`` method at any time,
     but the ``finalize()`` synchronization call allows it to wait until
     there is at least one node waiting for the result in the flow graph.
  
  
  Default implementation is empty.

.. caution::

   The ``async_msg`` class is copyable, so the user must provide correct
   copy routines in any derived class.
